This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(rsconnect)
library(shinythemes)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
library(base)
library(base64enc)
library(shinydashboard)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(corrplot)
library(lattice)
library(caret)
library(modeest)
library(moments)
library(ISLR)
library(GGally)
library(pROC)
library(lubridate)
```
```{r}
q <- Training
colnames(q)
q$MONTH_SHORT <- as.factor(q$MONTH_SHORT)
class(q$Time)

q$Time <- paste(q$MONTH_SHORT,"-", q$YEAR)
q$date <- NULL
head(q)
q$Time <- as.Date(q$Time)
as.Date(paste("01", q$MONTH_SHORT, sep = ""), format = "%d-%b-%y")
head(q$Time)
strptime("Jan-01","%b-%d")
strptime(q$Time,"%b-%d")

x <- "Jan-01"
q$Time <- dmy(paste("01-", q$Time , sep =""))
unique(floor_date(q$Time, "month"))

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
